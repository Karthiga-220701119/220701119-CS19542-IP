HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML, <br>
used to define the structure and content of a webpage. <br>
They are enclosed in angle brackets, with an opening tag <tagname> and, in most cases, a closing tag </tagname>.<br>
Tags can have attributes that provide additional information. For example, the <a> tag, used for hyperlinks, <br>
often includes an href attribute to specify the URL.
